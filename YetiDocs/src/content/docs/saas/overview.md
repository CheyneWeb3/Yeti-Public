# SaaS Overview

SaaS in YetiCashier is an entitlement system: a group account pays, and modules unlock.

## Core concepts

- **Group**: a billable entity (Telegram chat today; other platforms later)
- **Plan**: pricing + entitlements
- **Subscription**: active agreement between group and plan
- **Invoices**: recorded billing attempts and outcomes
- **Entitlements**: effective permissions a group has right now

## Why it exists

- Groups pay as a group (not per-user)
- Modules can monetize without every dev rebuilding billing
- Operators can run a clean marketplace of modules
